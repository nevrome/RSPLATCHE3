# RSPLATCHE3

This package provides a generally working, though untested workflow to use the population genetics simulation tool [SPLATCHE3](http://www.splatche.com/splatche3) from within R. See this script for a minimal example application: [playground/run_SPLATCHE3.R](https://github.com/nevrome/RSPLATCHE3/blob/master/playground/run_SPLATCHE3.R)

I started to work on this for an own research question, but realized that SPLATCHE3 is not well suited for my needs. I will not continue the development, but wanted to share this starting point in case somebody wants to take over.
